### StarFlow ###

**Update 8/21/20** The reference P4-tofino dataplane implementation has been added to /starflowCache/tofino. It originally ran on SDE 8.X.


This repo contains starflow source. Currently, there are generic P4 and C++ implementations of the cache component. Eventually, we will upload the complete end-to-end system here.
